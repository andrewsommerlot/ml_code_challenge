Thanks for your interest in the Machine Learning Engineer role at Senseye! We're interested in seeing how you approach a dataset that we've seen in our work.  Please review the attached csv and, using your background and experience, generate a predictor.  We typically would use a jupyter notebook for this kind of work, but feel free to use whatever tools you prefer.  This is a portion of a dataset that we've already worked with, and we're hoping to gain some insight on your thought processes and approach to problem solving. We understand that you have a life outside of applying for jobs, so we don't expect you to spend more than about 2 hours on this project. We are most interested in familiarizing ourselves with how you work.

Each row represents a 5 second window of time during a question & answer period.  Thus multiple slices are available for each question_number.

'participant_number' - Participants in this study were numbered to uniquely identify them
'difficulty' - the value we're interested in predicting
'question_number' - each participant is given several different questions 
'duration' - how long each bow event lasts
'count' - number of bow events in a given window
'frequency'  - rate of bow events
'magnitude' - bow magnitude

Please let us know if you have any questions or anything is unclear.

Thanks!
